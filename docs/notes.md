# Notes for Joshua's Branch

## August 15 Notes
- Made a possible about.html design
- Design looks like ass now but I'll change it up later

## Things to touch up on
- Since we have 10+ members, I'll make each person's section much smaller since this page is a huge mess
- **Should we consider shortening the bios?**
- Make each person's section a modal

## August 14 Updates
- Touched up on styling from yesterday
    - Made nav darker
    - Added section numbers
    - Added motto
    - Made image take full sizing of its own div
    - Nav has more links

- Added a second and third div

## Things to touch up on/look for
- Modify the second div
- Implement GSAP animations?
