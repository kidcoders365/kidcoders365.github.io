# Notes for Joshua's Branch

## August 15 Notes
- Made a possible about.html design
- Design looks like ass now but I'll change it up later

## Things to touch up on
- Since we have 10+ members, I'll make each person's section much smaller since this page is a huge mess
- **Should we consider shortening the bios?**
- Make each person's section a modal
- Add images from site, i was too lazy to put them
