                <p>KidCoders 365 is an organization that offers free, interactive programming classes for elementary, middle, and high school students, run by high school students in Maryland. Today’s kids often feel that there are limited opportunities to learn full programming languages. Our organization seeks to provide youth with free, unrestricted opportunities to explore computer programming, a vital skill in the modern world, as well as essential skills related to the subject.</p>

                            <p>Hey everyone! I'm Lucas and I'm a Junior at Richard Montgomery High School. Computer science-wise, I have been doing web development (HTML/CSS/JS) since 2018, and have created multiple websites. At school, I have taken courses such as AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science, and IB Computer Science.</p>
                            <p>Other than coding, I enjoy doing a variety of outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, and kayaking (if you ever want a hiking recommendation, just ask!). I also play basketball and tennis for fun, and like to run long distance.</p>
                            <p>Teaching coding is something I have tons of fun doing, and I'm really excited for an amazing summer season at KidCoders 365.</p>

                                passionate about programming. I generally enjoy programming in Python and I find machine

                            <p>I first encountered programming when I was around 10 or 11 years old back when I lived in
                                California when I found out about ROBLOX Studio and how you can make games with the
                                language Lua. However, I started to take it a bit more seriously during the summer
                                before 6th grade as I began learning basic web development and eventually Python. I,
                                however, didn’t further my knowledge of Python until around 2019, and since then I’ve
                                loved coding in it.</p>
